# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Heart Health Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing heart health indicators, including demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables. The objective is to uncover patterns, correlations, and significant predictors of heart disease through data analysis and visualization.

---

## Objectives
By the end of this project, the following goals will be achieved:
1. Understand the steps involved in EDA, including:
   - Data loading and inspection.
   - Data cleaning.
   - Analysis of relationships between variables.
2. Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
3. Identify and visualize patterns, anomalies, and correlations in the dataset.

## Dataset
- **Filename:** `heart_data.csv`
- **Description:**
  Contains information on heart health indicators, including demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables.

## Lab Tasks

### **Task 1: Data Loading and Inspection**
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Inspect the dataset (e.g., column names, data types, missing values).

### **Task 2: Data Cleaning**
1. Handle Misrepresented Data:
   - Check each column for correct data types.
   - Encode categorical columns if necessary.
2. Handle Missing Values:
   - Count missing values in each column.
   - Decide on strategies (e.g., imputation or removal).
3. Handle Duplicates:
   - Identify and remove duplicate records.

### **Task 3: Univariate Analysis**
1. Visualize distributions of numerical variables:
   - Use histograms and boxplots.
2. Analyze categorical variables:
   - Plot bar charts.

### **Task 4: Bivariate Analysis**
1. Numerical-Numerical Relationships:
   - Create scatterplots to explore relationships.
   - Calculate a correlation matrix.
2. Categorical-Numerical Relationships:
   - Compare target variable across independent variables using boxplots.
3. Categorical-Categorical Relationships:
   - Create a crosstab to explore relationships.

### **Task 5: Multivariate Analysis**
- Use pairplots to visualize multiple relationships simultaneously.

### **Task 6: Communication of Insights**
1. Summarize findings:
   - Identify significant predictors of heart disease.
   - Highlight notable patterns (e.g., risk factors in specific age groups or genders).
2. Create visualizations to support conclusions:
   - Present insights using PowerPoint or Jupyter Notebook.

## Deliverables
1. **Python Script/Notebook:** A complete EDA process in a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Report:** A PDF or Markdown file summarizing key findings and insights.
3. **Visuals:** High-quality plots and visualizations highlighting trends and relationships.
